on:
  # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request, but only for the main branch.
  # Reason: Until a feature branch is converted into a pull request, there's no (real) need
  #   to have this workflow waste resources and trigger 'workflow did not work' emails.

# Permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN for this workflow.

# NOTE: Because of this, we don't use "@hash" but "@vX" for non-GitHub steps below. Usually you would use "@hash"
#   as a security measure to pin a specific version. However, since we run with the minimal permissions
#   here, malicious code couldn't do much harm (most likely).

          #   We don't just use the sha because this workflow also runs on a schedule - which means that different
